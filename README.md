# Introduction 
WiMigrator is a command line tool designed with the following goals in mind:
* Migrate work items from one Azure DevOps/TFS project to another
* Real world example of how to use the WIT REST APIs
* Cross platform support

![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/vsts-wit/_apis/public/build/definitions/2a08f204-c80c-4f7e-82c8-f27e28f2becd/1/badge)

# Features
* Migrate the latest revision of a work item or set of work items based on the provided query, including:
  * Work item links (for work items within the query results set) 
  * Attachments
  * Git commit links (link to the source git commit)
  * Work item history (last 200 revisions as an attachment)
  * Tagging of the source items that have been migrated

# Getting Started
## Requirements
* Source Project on **Azure DevOps** or **TFS 2017 Update 2** or later
* Target Project on **Azure DevOps** or **TFS 2018** or later
* Personal access tokens or NTLM for authentication 
* Bypass rules or Project Collection Administrator permissions required on target project
* Process metadata **should** be consistent between the processes
  * Limited field mapping support is provided to map fields from the source to target account
  * Area/Iteration paths can be defaulted to a specific value when they don't exist on the target

## Running
WiMigrator supports the following command line options:
* --validate validates that the metadata between the source and target projects is consistent 
* --migrate re-runs validation and then migrates the work items 

Migration runs in two parts:
* Validation
  * Configuration settings
  * Process metadata is consistent between projects
  * Identifies any work items that were previously migrated
* Migration
  * Phase 1: Work item fields
  * Phase 2: Attachments, links, git commit links, history, target move tag
  * Phase 3: Source move tag

A [sample configuration](WiMigrator/sample-configuration.json) file is provided with [documentation](WiMigrator/migration-configuration.md) of all the settings.

Execution example:
```
dotnet run --validate configuration.json
```

## Limitations:
  * Artifact links (other than git) are not migrated
  * Board fields are not migrated
  * Test artifacts (e.g. test results) are not migrated
